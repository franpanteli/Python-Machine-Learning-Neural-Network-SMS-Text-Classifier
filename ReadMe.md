# Python-Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression-Health-Costs-Calculator
This repository contains my independent work for a machine learning model for SMS spam detection with Python, as part of the [final project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/neural-network-sms-text-classifier) in freeCodeCamp's [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/#machine-learning-with-python-projects) curriculum. The aim of this model is to classify text messages as "ham" (non-spam) or "spam", by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains labeled SMS messages, and the preprocessing steps involve converting the text data into a bag-of-words representation, followed by TF-IDF transformation to quantify the importance of words. The project explores different algorithms, including a Random Forest classifier, an XGBoost regressor, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The final model, based on SVM, demonstrates high accuracy in predicting spam messages. The evaluation metrics, including the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score, illustrate the model's performance on test data. The project presents this model in a prediction function and performs tests on this, for practical validation of the model's effectiveness in identifying SMS spam. The solution this project presents highlights the application of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges with Python, such as spam detection in SMS messages.
