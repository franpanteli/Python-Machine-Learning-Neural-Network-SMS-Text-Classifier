This repository contains my independent work in developing a machine learning model for SMS spam detection with Python, as part of the [final project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/neural-network-sms-text-classifier) in freeCodeCamp's [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/#machine-learning-with-python-projects) curriculum. The primary goal is to accurately classify text messages as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam" using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains labeled SMS messages, and the preprocessing steps involve converting the text data into a bag-of-words representation, followed by TF-IDF transformation to capture the importance of words. The project explores different algorithms, including a Random Forest classifier, an XGBoost regressor, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The final model, based on SVM, demonstrates high accuracy in predicting spam messages. The evaluation metrics, including the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score, illustrate the model's performance on test data. The project also includes a prediction function and unit tests for practical validation of the model's effectiveness in identifying SMS spam. The comprehensive approach presented here highlights the application of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges, such as spam detection in SMS messages.
