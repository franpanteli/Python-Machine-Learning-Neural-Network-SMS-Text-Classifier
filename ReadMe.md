# Python-Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression-Health-Costs-Calculator
This repository showcases my independent work in implementing a neural network-based model for predicting healthcare expenses based off of US patient demographics data. This is as part of the [fourth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/linear-regression-health-costs-calculator) in freeCodeCamp's [Machine Learning with Python curriculum.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/#how-neural-networks-work) Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, the neural network is structured sequentially with an input normalisation layer, two hidden layers using rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions, and an output layer with a single node. The model is compiled using a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function, the Adam optimisation algorithm (learning rate: 0.001), and metrics for MAE and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The dataset encompasses various patient demographics, including sex, age, BMI, and the number of children. Preprocessing steps in the project Jupyter notebook ((ipynb) Fran Panteli fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb) include normalising patient information using the neural network's normalisation layer, to ensure consistent scaling. Training occurs on 80% of the dataset, with evaluation on the remaining 20%. The model undergoes 600 epochs with a 0.2 validation split, to monitor potential overfitting. A plotting function visualises the training and validation loss curves. Unit tests assess predictive accuracy, using 20% of the dataset reserved for testing. Metrics such as the MAE and MSE are employed, alongside a scatter plot illustrating the correlation between true and predicted healthcare expenses. Success criteria involve achieving an MAE below 3,500. This encompasses neural network architecture and unit tests for a healthcare expense prediction model, offering insights into the application of machine learning with Python in healthcare analytics.
